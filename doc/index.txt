pmtr::
  a Linux process supervisor that can start your executables or scripts
  at system boot, and restart them as needed

pmtr: process monitor
---------------------
Pmtr is a supervisor daemon that starts your programs and then babysits them.
Most "standard" system services (httpd, sshd, etc) have initscripts, which are
the typical way to run daemons on Linux. For programs you wrote yourself, or
your local application servers that don't have initscripts, you might find
pmtr easier to use or its features beneficial. Your jobs go in pmtr.conf:

.Example `/etc/pmtr.conf`
--------------------------------------------------------

  job {
    name rest_server
    cmd /usr/bin/python rest.py
  }

  # set working directory, keep errors
  job {
    name ws-server
    dir /home/maps
    cmd /usr/bin/node maps.js
    err /tmp/maps.err
  }

  # restart if dependencies change
  job {
    name proxy
    cmd /usr/bin/proxy -c /etc/proxy.cfg
    depends {
      /etc/proxy.cfg
    }
  }
  
  # bounce this job every hour, raise ulimits
  job {
    name thermostat
    dir /home/thermo
    cmd /usr/bin/python therm.py
    bounce every 1h
    ulimit {
      -n infinity
      -l infinity
    }
    user nobody
  }

--------------------------------------------------------

See the <<options,full options>> below, and the <<requirements,requirements>>
for pmtr jobs. Pmtr applies changes immediately when the config file is edited.
The pmtr daemon itself is small, written in C, open-source and for Linux only.
It runs on Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL/CentOS, in Docker containers, and others.

.Why did I write it?
**************************************************************************
I wrote pmtr because I wanted one simple configuration file where I could
list all my programs, knowing that they'd be run at boot, get restarted if 
they exit, and they'd react immediately to configuration files changes.
**************************************************************************

.Does it work?
The author has used pmtr for several years in production on hundreds of systems
having dozens of jobs each.  If you find a bug or have a new feature to suggest-
please use the https://github.com/troydhanson/pmtr[pmtr Github page].

Download & Install
------------------

You can use the https://github.com/troydhanson/pmtr[Github page] to:

 * download a https://github.com/troydhanson/pmtr/archive/master.zip[zipfile]. 
 * or, git clone https://github.com/troydhanson/pmtr.git

To build and install:

  cd pmtr
  make
  sudo make install

The result of installation is:

 * the executable: `/usr/bin/pmtr` 
 * the configuration file: `/etc/pmtr.conf` 
 * an OS-specific initscript to run pmtr at boot 

Running
-------

After installation, pmtr should already be running. Verify using `service pmtr
status`. 

service start/stop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can use the system's service command to start or stop pmtr itself.
If you stop pmtr, it first stops any jobs that it's running, then exits.

  service pmtr stop
  service pmtr start

You can also run pmtr on the command-line. By default, it forks into the
background. You can tell it to stay in the foreground using `-F`. 

Command line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While pmtr is normally run as a background service, you can run it manually on
the command line, in which case you can specify these flags:

[width="80%",cols="20m,20,50",grid="none",options="none"]
|==========================================================================
| -c <file> | config file | specify alternate configuration file
| -t        | test only   | parse config file and exit, implies -F
| -F        | Foreground  | stay in foreground instead of detaching
| -v        | verbose     | extra logging. repeatable. -vv shows parsing
|==========================================================================

[[logging]]
Logging
~~~~~~~
Look in syslog (typically `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/syslog`) to see
pmtr log messages relating to configuration file changes and job activity.

  Nov  7 1:38:09 ubuntu pmtr[477]: rescanning job configuration
  Nov  7 1:38:10 ubuntu pmtr[477]: started job proxy [478]
  Nov  7 1:38:20 ubuntu pmtr[477]: job proxy [478] exited after 10 sec: exit status 0

If your job isn't running, this is the first place to look. Pmtr is verbose
about restarting jobs, or indicating if they are exiting for some reason.

[[requirements]]
Job requirements
----------------
In pmtr the job is just some executable that you want to keep running. It must:

 * stay in the foreground
 * exit on SIGTERM or SIGKILL 
 * clean up any sub-processes when it exits

.Restarts
Since pmtr is designed to keep things running, if a job exits, pmtr restarts it.

* If a job exits quickly (within ten seconds of when it started) pmtr 
  waits ten seconds then restarts it. This avoids rapid restart cycles. The
  job probably has some sort of configuration problem if it exits quickly.
* Exit status 33 can be returned from a process to tell pmtr not to restart it.

Configuration file 
------------------
The default pmtr configuration file is `/etc/pmtr.conf`. 

Syntax check
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To manually check the syntax of a configuration file, use the `-t` (test) flag:
  
  pmtr -tc /etc/pmtr.conf

This displays any syntax errors. In normal background operation pmtr
would log syntax and other errors via syslog; see <<logging,logging>>.

Immediate effect 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you edit and save `pmtr.conf`, the changes get applied immediately. 

 * A newly-added job gets started.
 * A deleted job is terminated.
 * A changed job is restarted with its new configuration.

To terminate a job, pmtr sends SIGTERM to it, then SIGKILL shortly afterward.

Syntax summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The configuration file contains any number of jobs. 

* Each job is in a curly-brace delimited block.  
* The order of options inside does not matter. 
* Only the `name` and `cmd` are required.
* Indentation is optional. 
* Blank lines are ok.  
* Comments start with `#` and must be on their own line.

.A job with many options 
---------------------------------------------------
  # trending service
  # restarted daily 

  job {
    name trends
    dir /home/trends
    cmd /usr/bin/python trends.py
    bounce every 1d
    err trends.err
    ulimit -n infinity
    depends {
      trends.conf
      db.conf
    }
    user pyuser
    env DEBUG=1
  }
---------------------------------------------------

[[options]]
[width="90%",cols="20m,50",grid="none",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
|option         | argument
|name           | descriptive job name used for logging - must be unique
|cmd            | executable (fully-qualified) and any arguments 
|dir            | working directory (fully qualified) to run the process in
|out            | send stdout to this file
|err            | send stderr to this file
|in             | hook stdin to this file
|env            | environment variable setting `VAR=VALUE` (repeatable)
|user           | unix username under whose id to run the process 
|ulimit         | a flag and value, or a curly-brace delimited list of them
|bounce every   | a time interval like 5m (five minutes) - units are `smhd`
|depends        | a curly-brace delimited list of files, one per line
|disable        | this keyword disables the job 
|===============================================================================

Further information about these options appears below.

cmd
~~~
* The executable named in the `cmd` must have its executable-bit set. 
* The `cmd` may include trailing arguments e.g. `cmd /bin/node server.js`.  
* The `cmd` may contain double-quoted arguments e.g. `cmd /bin/echo "hello world"`
* The `cmd` does no shell expansion: no wildcards, backticks, variables, etc. 

[TIP]
If you need shell features in your command, wrap it with a shell script. You
can even do this "inline" by passing your commands as a string to bash:

  env DIR=/home/ws
  cmd /bin/bash -c "/bin/python ws.py -d $DIR/`date +%s`"

env
~~~
* Use `env` to push an environment variable into a job, e.g. `env TMPDIR=/tmp`.
* Use `env` repeatedly to set multiple environment variables.

disable
~~~~~~~
* Use `disable` to stop a job, without having to comment it out.
* This is often helpful in debugging a job since it makes it easy to 
  re-enable the job later (by commenting out the disable line, or removing it).

out, err, in
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Use `out`, `err`, and `in` to attach stdout, stderr or stdin to a file.
* The stdout, stderr and stdin default to `/dev/null`.

user
~~~~
* The `user` option is the unix username that should be the process owner.
* The `user` defaults to root usually, when pmtr is running as a service.
* The `user` defaults to whoever started pmtr, if pmtr was run manually.

depends
~~~~~~~
* Use a `depends` block to specify files, one per line, that the job depends on.
* If the content of any of the dependencies changes, pmtr restarts the job.

bounce every
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The `bounce every` option restarts the job every so often. 
* It's intended for jobs that don't behave well as long-running processes. 
* It takes a number and unit, like `5m` to restart a job every five minutes. 
* The units are `smhd`- (s)econds, (m)inutes, (h)ours or (d)ays. 
* The interval should be more than 10 seconds. 
* The exact timing of the restart is approximate.

ulimit
~~~~~~
* Use `ulimit` to modify the kernel-enforced resource limits for the job.
* It takes a flag denoting which limit to set, and a value, e.g., `ulimit -n 30`.  
* Alternatively, you can list a series of ulimit settings in a curly brace block:

  ulimit {
    -n infinity
    -l 10000
  }

* The values are all numeric or the keyword `infinity`.
* To see the current kernel limits on a process, run `cat /proc/<pid>/limits`.
* pmtr sets both the "hard" and "soft" ulimit to the same value.
* If there is an error setting the ulimits, it's logged to syslog.
* The meaning of the flags like `-n` are explained in the bash shell itself:
* In bash, type `ulimit -a` in bash to list flags, and the values in your shell;
* In bash, type `help ulimit` for more information about the ulimits;
* In bash, type `man prlimit` to see the more technical description and the units.

One-time jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For "initial setup" situations, pmtr has basic support for one-time jobs. The
`wait` option makes pmtr wait for the job to exit before starting subsequent
jobs. To keep pmtr from restarting it, use the `once` option. 

  job {
        name create-ramdisk
        cmd /bin/mkdir -p /dev/shm/ws/data
        wait
        once
  }

Experimental 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
These features are disabled by default.

These configuration options may appear in `pmtr.conf` at the global scope.

  report to udp://127.0.0.1:9999
  listen on udp://0.0.0.0:10000

The `report to` option designates a remote address and port to which pmtr should
send a a UDP packet every ten seconds.  The packet payload lists the job names,
enabled or disabled status, and elapsed runtimes in simple text. (An included
script `pmtr/utils/pmtr-rptserver` can receive these reports and write updates
to a text file summarizing the received status messages. This script is invoked
like `pmtr-rptserver -p 9999 -f status.txt`).  If the `report to` address falls
in the multicast UDP range (e.g.  239.0.0.1, etc), the specification may include
a trailing interface, e.g., `report to udp://239.0.0.1:9999@eth2` to explicitly
designate the interface from which the multicast UDP datagrams should egress. 

The `listen on` option allows jobs to be remotely enabled or disabled. It
specifies a UDP address and port that pmtr should listen on for datagrams of
form `enable abc` or `disable abc`, where 'abc' is a job name.  The address
0.0.0.0 can be used as a shortcut to denote "any address" on this system. (A
script in `pmtr/utils/pmtr-ctl` may be used to send the datagrams, for example 
`pmtr-ctl -s 192.168.0.22 -p 10000 enable abc`). The effect is temporary; the
settings in pmtr.conf resume precedence when it's edited or pmtr is restarted.

Tips
----

pstree
~~~~~~
To get a nice visual confirmation of the jobs you have running under pmtr, you
can use the `pstree` utility, if you have it installed.  Here is the output of
`pstree -p`.

.Example pstree output
----------------------------------------
        ├─pmtr(2830)─┬─pmtr(2834)
        │            ├─proxy(2831)
        │            ├─sshd(2832)
        │            └─python(2833)
----------------------------------------

The other system processes have been omitted. Note that pmtr has its own child
process. This is the dependency monitor that watches the config file.

Using pmtr with Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://www.docker.com/[Docker] is a Linux container technology. If you're using
Docker, you can use pmtr as the initial process of a Docker container to run a
process hierarchy inside the container. Make sure pmtr runs in the foreground
using the `-F` flag, since the container exits if the initial process detaches.

  /usr/bin/pmtr -F -c config.conf 

If you're writing a Dockerfile to build your Docker images, you can use `CMD` to
designate pmtr as default initial process for the image.

.Dockerfile using pmtr 
  CMD [ "/usr/bin/pmtr", "-F", "-c", "/etc/container-pmtr.conf" ]
